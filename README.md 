#  Anomaly Detection in Transaction Data

This project explores **rule-based and ML-based anomaly detection** for financial transactions.  
The goal is to detect suspicious activity not only by **amount**, but also by **behavioral inconsistencies** such as unusual hours, missing metadata, and rare device/location combinations.

## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features & Rules
Transactions are flagged if they meet one or more criteria:

-  High amount anomalies: Amount > £4000
- Weekend transactions: `is_weekend = True`
-  Missing metadata: No `device` or `location`
-  Odd hours: Transactions between 10 PM – 6 AM
-  Rare patterns: Uncommon device/location combos

We combine these with:
-  Isolation Forest(unsupervised anomaly detection)
- DBSCAN clustering(density-based anomaly detection)

---

##  Visualizations
Some example plots included:

- Anomaly rate by rule
- High amount anomalies vs. normal transactions
- Behavioral red flags (missing metadata, odd hours, weekends)

Example:

##  Tech Stack
- Python : pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Machine Learning : Isolation Forest, DBSCAN
- Visualization : Bar plots, scatter plots, anomaly overlays
